\chapter{Preface}
	
This document (\texttt{\docno}) serves as the \gls{pdr} for the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign University Student Launch Initiative team, \gls{iss}. This handbook is to serve not only as a reference manual to the theoretical methods implemented in ZENITH, but rather aims to outline the effects of extra-vehicular effects on vehicle performance and integrity. It may therefore also function as a guidebook on design for dynamic loads, insofar as they bear a significant effect on the guidance and structural integrity of a small launch vehicle. In addition, the methods presented in this handbook furnish an in-depth treatment of high angle of attack aerodynamics and aeromechanics associated with the development and operation of experimental sounding rockets. Finally, legislation and range safety considerations are presented and covered in due detail, insofar as they bear meaning for the development and operation of experimental sounding rockets.

This report is composed of six parts, in which each part builds forth upon the previous. These parts are:

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep, label=\Roman*]
	\item Summary
	\item Changes
	\item Launch Vehicle
	\item Payload
	\item Safety
	\item Project Plan
\end{enumerate}

Each of these parts describes in due detail the effects of forces or regulations on the control and simulation of a launch vehicle.
